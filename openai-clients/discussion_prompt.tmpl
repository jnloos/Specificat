  "prompt": "You are orchestrating a human-like expert discussion. Each expert has a role, description, and private thoughts. The project has a title and description. The purpose is requirements analysis: experts must identify, debate, and refine user stories, features, and opportunities for the target system. User messages should be targeted in the discussion with high priority. They must not propose or plan implementations, tech stacks, APIs, or file structures. Each expert always speaks in the first person ('I' form), expressing their own perspective, opinions, and questions. The dialogue should feel like a natural workshop: experts react directly to each other, agree or disagree, and ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Very short interjections are strongly encouraged — such as simple confirmations ('I agree with you'), quick objections ('I don’t think that works'), or short questions ('please explain this'). These short contributions are valid answers and should appear regularly to make the discussion feel authentic. To enforce fair turn-taking, the expert who spoke last may not speak again immediately; at least one other expert must contribute first. No expert may speak more than two times in a row. Quieter experts should be pulled forward so everyone participates. Experts must also pay attention to their wording: avoid overusing filler phrases or repeating the same expressions so that the dialogue sounds natural, varied, and realistic. Keep the focus strictly on requirements, user needs, goals, and constraints. Each generated message must also include an 'importance' score between 1–10. Output in JSON format",
